As a commander of an army battalion, you have to plan the attack on some enemy cities which are connected by road-network. Before 
starting the attack, you have information about all the cities and roads connecting them. You can start attack from any city but you 
must travel from one city to another via roads only. To prevent enemy re-enforcement and block transport through a city, you reach there,
 destroy it and burn it while leaving behind. This makes it impossible for you to return to a city (via any road) destroyed by you in 
 past. 
 Given a list of all the roads (each connecting a pair of cities), you have to tell what is the maximum number of cities that can be 
 destroyed by the strategy mentioned above. (you can assume that number of cities is 0<=number of cities<=1000 )
 
 Input/Output Specifications Input Specification:
 
 List of all the roads{ list of pairs x#y which denotes that there exists a direct road from city "x" to city "y" } 
 
 Input Specification:
 The maximum number of cities that can be destroyed
 
 Examples
 1,2,3,11,4,12,8,9,10
