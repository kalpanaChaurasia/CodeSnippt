HashMap VS TreeMap


1. HashMap implements Map interface while TreeMap implements SortedMap interface. A Sorted Map interface is a child of Map.

2. HashMap implements Hashing, while TreeMap implements Red-Black Tree(a Self Balancing Binary Search Tree). Therefore all 
	differences between Hashing and Balanced Binary Search Tree apply here.
	
3. Both HashMap and TreeMap have their counterparts HashSet and TreeSet. HashSet and TreeSet implement Set interface. 
	In HashSet and TreeSet, we have only key, no value, these are mainly used to see presence/absence in a set. 
	For above problem, we can’t use HashSet (or TreeSet) as we can’t store counts. 
	An example problem where we would prefer HashSet (or TreeSet) over HashMap (or TreeMap) is to print all distinct elements in an array.
