/**
 * TreeMap can be a bit handy when we only need to store unique elements in a sorted order. 
 * Java.util.TreeMap uses a red-black tree in the background which makes sure that there are no duplicates; 
 * additionally it also maintains the elements in a sorted order.
 
 		TreeMap<K, V> hmap = new TreeMap<K, V>();
 * 
 * 
 * key points :-

		For operations like add, remove, containsKey, time complexity is O(log n where n is number of elements present in TreeMap.
		
		TreeMap always keeps the elements in a sorted(increasing) order, while the elements in a HashMap have no order. 
		
		TreeMap also provides some cool methods for first, last, floor and ceiling of keys.
